Steps to compile and run (in Linux based OS - say, Ubuntu):

Prerequisites: The system must have python3 installed

Steps:
1. Open terminal
2. cd into the downloaded folder
2. Type the following command to run the program:
	$ python3 viterbi.py <sequence>
	
	eg., $ python3 viterbi.py 333112221


To be Noted: 

* Make sure that the system information is present in a file -in the same folder - in the expected format (refer to the attached sample for the format)

* The symbols used in the testing sequence must be the same as the ones used in the system info file

* You can use observation sequence of any length to test
